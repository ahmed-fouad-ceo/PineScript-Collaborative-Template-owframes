# Pine Script Collaborative Template (MPL 2.0)

This repository hosts a foundational template written in **Pine Script v6** under the **Mozilla Public License 2.0**. It serves as a starting point for building production-ready TradingView indicators or strategies with community collaboration.

We are looking for contributors to help expand this template into a versatile tool. Specific areas include:
1.  **Feature Expansion:** Adding volatility/momentum overlays.
2.  **Optimization:** Refactoring for faster execution on longer timeframes.
3.  **Documentation:** Improving comments and the usage guide.
